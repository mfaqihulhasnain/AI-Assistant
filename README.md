Jokes: Fetches and tells programming-related jokes using the JokeAPI. Alarms & Reminders: Sets alarms and reminders for a specific duration, providing time-based notifications. Technologies Used: speech_recognition for capturing user voice commands. pyttsx3 for converting text responses into speech. requests to fetch news and jokes from APIs. datetime and threading to handle time-based tasks like alarms and reminders. This project is designed to provide hands-free interaction with a variety of tasks, leveraging the power of speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis.
